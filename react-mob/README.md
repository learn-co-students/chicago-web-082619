# MOB-ifesto! (user stories)

I'd like to see a React App
I'd like the app to say hi
I'd like the app to be structured in a way that makes maintenance easy
I'd like to see an updating "stock price on the screen"
I'd like the stock price to be between 1 and 100
I'd like the stock price to have a background that's red or green
I'd like the color to reflect whether the price has just gone up(green) or down(red)
