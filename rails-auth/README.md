# Auth in Rails

##### What is the difference between sign-in and sign up?

Sign-up happens once, and afterwards the information that is used to authenticate a user exists in the system for sign-in.

##### What is authentication?

It boils down to a really interesting question: _Are you who you say you are?_ And we use the username/password as a proxy for that.

##### What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?

Authorization happens after authentication. It's about scope, and specific information. _What is the user allowed to see/interact with?_

##### What is the difference between hashing and encrypting?

What is encryption? What can be encrypted? Anything that can be encrypted, must also be able to be decrypted. In order to decrypt a cypher, you need to know the cypher used and any parameters (offset, perhaps) used to encrypt the information.

Hashing is a little different: the ultimate goal of one-way hashing is that you cannot "decrypt" the original text. In addition to any encryption scheme, each authenticated user has a "salt", added information that augments the password to make decryption even harder.  

### Using `bcrypt` to create passwords in Rails
What's cool about `bcrypt`? By design, it's slow. This means that anyone who wants to crack it has to take a long time to brute-force passwords. It also allows you to define a column called `password_digest` and it will do the rest of the work.

_Remember, convention over configuration._ And especially in this case, we generally don't have the time or energy to build our own encryption that surpasses what already exists.

After installing the `bcrypt` gem, you can use a macro in your user model called `has_secure_password`, which does a lot of the integration for you. 

Now that you've created a user with a password, you can do `user.authenticate("password")`.

Now you can build a `form_for` for the `new` action:

```erb
<%= form_with model: @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :username %>
  <%= f.text_field :username %>
  <%= f.label :password %>
  <%= f.text_field :password %>
  <%= f.label :password_confirmation %>
  <%= f.text_field :password_confirmation %>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
```

Making the `create` controller:

```ruby
@user = User.new(user_params)
if @user.valid?
  @user.save
  redirect_to @user
else
  redirect_to new_user_path
end
```

Our form doesn't hide the password in the `input`, so change the text field to `f.password_field`.

So, to recap the necessary steps:
1. `password_digest` as an attribute in our `users` table
2. `bcrypt` installed in `Gemfile`
3. `has_secure_password` in the `User` model

### Sessions and cookies
How does an application keep you logged in between requests? Remember, requests are stateless, so sessions allow us to provide a user a sense of continuity as the interact with the website.  

How do cookies fit into this? Ultimately, they're just key-value pairs. Each website has it's own cookies, and  cookies aren't secure, because they're not necessarily encrypted.

What information do we want to store in the cookie?

Sessions aren't really stored in the database, so we don't use a model for them. However, they still need routes, a controller and views.

`routes.rb `
```ruby
get "signup", to: "users#new", as: "signup"
get "login", to: "sessions#new", as: "login"
post "sessions", to: "sessions#create", as: "sessions"
```

`sessions_controller.rb`
```ruby
def new
  # don't need anything in here, cause we're not setting up a
  # blank model to couple with the form
end

def create
  # no strong params cause there is no mass assignment
  user = User.find_by(username: params[:username])
  if @user && @user.authenticate(params[:password])
    redirect_to @user
  else
    redirect_to login_path
  end
end
```


`sessions/new.html.erb`



```erb
<%= form_with url: sessions_path do %>
  <%= label_tag "Username" %>
  <%= text_field_tag :username %>
  <%= label_tag "Password" %>
  <%= password_field_tag :password %>
  <%= submit_tag "Sign In" %>
<% end %>
```

#### Authorization and User-specific content 


Augment `sessions_controller#create` with the following line after a successful authentication:
```ruby
session[:user_id] = @user.id
```
This allows us to save the user_id in the session cookie. `session` persists across the entire usage of the application, and `flash` works just between 2 requests. Show that this new code adds the cookie in browser as well.

Here are the steps that we can use to get our user's songs through the session:
1. Get the sessions by user_id
2. Get the user by user_id
3. get the songs by user

In `SongsController#index`:
```ruby
if session[:user_id]
  @user = User.find(session[:user_id])
  @songs = @user.songs
else
  @songs = Song.all # or force a login
end
```
Show how this works and filter's the song by user (when logged in). However, you don't want to do this work over and over again. Where can you do this? `ApplicationController`!

`application_controller.rb`

```ruby
def current_user
  if session[:user_id]
    @user = User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])
  else
  end
end

def logged_in?
  !!current_user
end
```

Now, you can refactor `SongsController#index`
```ruby
if logged_in?
  @songs = current_user.songs
else
  @songs = Song.all # or force a login
end
```
This is still not perfect. We want to be able to redirect to the login page if the user isn't logged in yet.

Add the following to `ApplicationController`:
```ruby
def authorized
  redirect_to login_path unless logged_in?
end
```

Now, in each controller/action that needs to do this redirect, you can add:
```ruby
before_action :authorized
```
Make sure not to use this for the login path. Instead, you should use:
```ruby
skip_before_action :authorized, only: [:new, :create] # or whatever onlys you need
```

#### Logging out 

So how do you log out? By destroying the session.

`routes.rb`
```ruby
delete "sessions", to: "sessions#destroy"
```

`sessions_controller.rb`
```ruby
def destroy
  session.delete(:user_id) # or session[:user_id] = nil
end
```

The best place to do this is in `application.html.erb`, but to expose our controller's method here, we must use the `helper_method :logged_in?` macro in our `ApplicationController`

Finally, in `application.html.erb`:

```erb
<% if logged_in? %>
  <%= link_to "Logout", sessions_path, method: :delete %>
<% else %>
  <%= link_to "Login", login_path %>
<% end %>
```
